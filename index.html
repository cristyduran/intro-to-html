    <p>Chapter 1, Apply Your Knowledge</p>

    <p>I am using VS Code as my text editor to complete this assignment.</p>

    <p>To start a website you need to understand the basics of HTML and have a code editor. 
        HTML is the structure for text in a webpage. Semantic HTML describes tag names
        that label sections in the text document. Using semantic HTML is important for 
        accessibility is a it guides screenreaders through a webpage based on the semantic tags.

    <p>After reading chapter 1, I now understand how the browser meets
        the meta tag to display a webpage properly. I also gained some insight into
        how to start planning for a website. </p>
